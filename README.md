The "Pong" game written in Processing

Minimum features:
Two players (or one player using two hands) control the paddles by moving them vertically in the gutters on left and right sides to hit a ball. Points are earned when the other side fails to return the ball, and the ball is restarted for the next round. To be fair, the ball is started in the left direction if it is an odd round, and in the right direction if it is an even round. The ball's velocity is randomly generated and becomes faster and faster if it keeps being hit by the paddles (this is my change to the original "Pong" game). The side that first reaches 10 points is the winner. 

Features and improvements that I would like to add:
- Change colors of the background, text, ball and paddles to make it more beautiful
- Add sounds for situations where the paddle hits the ball and where it doesn't, and game over
- Add "restart" and "quit" buttons after each game for users to select
- Enable users to choose difficulty levels (basically, the starting speed of the ball)
- Make it a 4-side game

How to play:
Left side: press letter key "w" to move the paddle up, and "s" to move the paddle down; release key to stop moving.  
Right side: press arrow key "up" to move the paddle up, and "down" to move the paddle down; release key to stop moving.
